            This searchable database makes it possible to get to know much more 
            about local colour, in the form of media illustrations and literary 
            texts. Who were the artists making illustrations of the region for 
            the press? What kind of images of specific regions were made, and 
            what did these illustrations focus on? Who were major local colour 
            authors from this period, and what regions did they write about?
        </p>


        <p>
            These are questions that you can explore through the data collected 
            here. It is possible to search on names, titles but also on regions. 
            This helps you to see how the region you are interested in was 
            imagined at the time, or to find out what texts about this region 
            were written.
        </p>

        <p>
            The database also incorporates a map search that can be filtered, 
            and makes it possible to compare the cultural production of 
            regionalism over a selected period, or in connection to specific 
            countries, provinces and even municipalities.

            Regions and their communities and traditions were immensely popular 
            during the nineteenth and early twentieth century. Regional culture 
            was central to the visual arts and was displayed at various world 
            exhibitions which took place between 1851 and 1913. Newspapers 
            published reports about ways of living in localities at home and 
            abroad. Especially from the mid century when illustrated news became 
            common, these periodicals provided their readers with glimpses of 
            life in regions such as Friesland, Cornwall, The Black Forest, 
            Brittany, Andalusia and Dalarna. 
        </p>

        <p>
            What is more, literary fiction about regional life was a widely read 
            genre, and helped consolidate the reputation of authors such as 
            Thomas Hardy, Jacob Jan Cremer, Berthold Auerbach, Selma Lagerlöf, 
            Giovanni Verga and Alphonse Daudet.
        </p>
        <p>
            What makes this flourishing production of cultural representations 
            of the region even more interesting is that they travelled across 
            national borders. Literary  works were translated, or reprinted in 
            special editions for the transatlantic market; illustrations of 
            regions were reprinted in different national contexts, and authors 
            of local colour fiction were reviewed in the foreign press.
